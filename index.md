Hi There! 

What I intend to do here, is to write. Write my heart out. Just write, write, write. And I can't even write. So bear me here. 
Also, writing my thoughts down, forces me to think more clearly, vividly. Also, it forces me, in a way, to come to some kind of a conclusion. Whether that is of use or not is debatable. 
In short, what I am going to do here, is just ramble. maybe blabber.
